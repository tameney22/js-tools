# JavaScript Tools Documentation

**Site:** <https://js-tools397.netlify.app/>

This documentation site was build using [MkDocs](https://www.mkdocs.org/) with the [Material Theme](https://squidfunk.github.io/mkdocs-material/).

## Getting Started

To install the required python libraries, run in your terminal:

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Next, run the MkDocs live preview server, so you can preview the changes you make as you write the documentation. The server will automatically rebuild the site upon saving. Run:

```
mkdocs serve
```
