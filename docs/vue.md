## Comparison with React

### Similarities

- Both react and vue use a virtual DOM. The virtual DOM is the representation of the UI that is kept in memory. It is synced with the real DOM when data in the UI is updated. It was pioneered by the [React team](https://reactjs.org/docs/faq-internals.html) and used in a number of JavaScript frameworks.

- They use reactive and composable view components.
- Both frameworks also focus on the core library, leaving concerns about routing and global state management to companion libraries.

### Differences

- In React, HTML structures are expressed via JSX, an XML-like syntax that works within JavaScript, to be rendered. Vue offers [templates](https://vuejs.org/guide/essentials/template-syntax.html) as an alternative, which is just additional syntax on top of plain HTML.

- Vueâ€™s companion libraries for state management and routing are all officially supported, while React leaves these concerns to the community.
